# GBA Link Cable Mystery Event Distributor

This is based on GBA LinkCable Dumper by FIX94, a GC and Wii Homebrew App to get GBA BIOS, ROMs and saves via the GC GBA Link Cable.

This modification works with Pokémon GBA games and allows to inject official Nintendo Events to the savegames in the cartridge.

Please, consider making a backup with the standard GBA Link Cable by FIX94: https://github.com/FIX94/gba-link-cable-dumper/releases

Save Support based on SendSave by Chishm.  
GBA BIOS Dumper by Dark Fader.  

# Usage
Just have Wiimote or a GC Controller in Port 1 and a GBA without a game inserted or aborted game launch by holding select+start in Port 2, then follow on screen instructions to select the event to receive. Events are region locked to official region distributions by Nintendo, if you want to do more elaborate work, please use the PC tool: https://github.com/suloku/wc-tool/releases
